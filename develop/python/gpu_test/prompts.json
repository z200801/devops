  "1": "Generate a first-person cockpit view video of an F-16 fighter jet flying over the ocean at a height of 10 meters. The perspective should be from within the cockpit, allowing the viewer to see the ocean waves below and distant mountain ranges in the horizon. The video should show the interior details of the cockpit and the pilot's controls, while also highlighting the speed and agility of the F-16 as it maneuvers through the air."
